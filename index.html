    <h1>Healthy Terms</h1>
    <ol class="glossary">
        <li>BMI: Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the bodyâ€™s fat content, calculated from measurements of height and weight and are used to determine if your weight is healthy. A healthy BMI is 24.9.</li><br>
        <li>Waist measurements: Carrying excess body fat around your middle is more of a health risk than if weight is on your hips and thighs. Waist circumference is a better estimate of visceral fat, the dangerous internal fat that coats the organs. It is therefore a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular, type 2 diabetes, cancer and stroke risks.</li><br>
        <li>Women waist measurements: Measurements greater than 35 inches increases risk of  health problems even if at a healthy weight.</li><br>
        <li>Men waist measurements: Measurements greater than 40 inches increases risk of health problems even if at a healthy weight.</li><br>
        <li>BMR: Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the rate at which the body uses energy while at rest to keep vital functions going, such as breathing and keeping warm.</li><br>
        <li> TDEE: Total Daily Energy Expenditure(TDEE) is the total amount of energy that the body burns with corresponding activity level.</li><br>
        <li>Activity Level: BMR is multiplied by corresponding activity level to determine TDEE(activity level in parenthesis).</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sedentary- People who work desk jobs and engage in very little exercise or chores.(1.2)</li>
            <li>Lightly active - People who do chores and go on long walks/engage in exercise at least 1 to 3 days in a week.(1.375)</li>
            <li>Moderately active -	People who move a lot during the day and workout (moderate effort) at least 3 to 5 days in a week. (1.55)</li>
            <li>Very active - People who play sports or engage in vigorous exercise on most days.(1.725)</li>
            <li>Extra active - People who do intense workouts 6 to 7 days a week with work that demands physical activity.(1.9)</li>
          </ul><br>
         <li>When trying to lose/gain weight, a general rule of thumb is to reduce/increase your calorie intake by 500 calories than your body needs (TDEE) to maintain your current weight.
            This will help you lose/gain about 1 pound (0.45 kg) of body weight per week.</li><br>
         <li>Water: Water is your body's principal chemical component and makes up about 50% to 70% of your body weight. Your body depends on water to survive. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine determined that an adequate daily fluid intake is:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men</li>
            <li>11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women</li>
        </ul><br>
        <li>Check out additional resources for insights on exercise, nutrition and music.</li><br>
        <li>Professional Advice: Always consult with your doctor because there are many factors that can affect your healthy weight.</li>
